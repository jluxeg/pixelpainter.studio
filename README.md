# pixelpainter.studio v0.1

[Try pixelpainter.studio now!](https://pixelpainter.studio)

pixelpainter.studio is a free responsive browser-based tool for designing and downloading pixel art images for use anywhere on anything. There are no users, databases, or cookies; files are saved to your browser/device via `localStorage`. Meaning you can download and run pixelpainter.studio locally on your desktop by opening `/dist/index.html` in a browser, when you have no access to internet.

## The Tools

Tools with an associated keyboard shortcut have the key listed after their name.
- Paintbrush `b`: Colors target pixels with the active painting color.
- Paint Bucket `g`: Fills an unbroken area of pixels with the active painting color.
	- (note: it may take a second to process larger areas.)
- Eraser `e`: Clears target pixels of color.
- Color Replace `f`: Changes *all* pixels of the same color to the active painting color.
- Eyedropper `i`: Sets the active painting color to the color of the target pixel. Reverts to previous tool after use.

### Other Buttons

- Undo `ctrl/cmd + z`: Undoes the previous painting action, up to 20 of the most recent actions.
- Redo `shift + ctrl/cmd + z`: Redoes the previously undid painting action.
- Clear Canvas: Removes color from all pixels, clears the undo and redo states, and empties the filename input.
- Toggle Grid `t`: Shows/hides the grid overlay display.


## File Actions

- Filename Input: Accepts letters, numbers, and hyphens. Spaces will be replaced with hyphens. If left empty, the default value used will be the current unix timestamp.
- Save Progress `ctrl/cmd + s`: Uses the value from filename input to save the current canvas in `localStorage`. Files are structured as a string of color codes.
	- *How many files can I save?* This is between you and your god. During testing the big 4 browsers were handling 100+ files fine, however your results may vary.
	- *I don't have localStorage* You won't be able to save your progress, but you can still paint and download.
- Download JPG/PNG: Saves the current artwork to your device in the selected file format as `pps_<filename input>`.
	- *What dimensions will my file be?* Currently the image size will be determined by the canvas size on your screen. The [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) has plans for custom dimension sizes.
- Load (file): Loads a previously saved artwork from `localStorage`. Fills filename input with the saved file name.
- Delete (file): Permanently deletes the save file from your browser/device `localStorage`.

## Background

**Inspiration:** After seeing my kids play a few paint-by-number pixel style apps, I wondered how a freeform browser painting tool could work.

**Goal:** To make something that my kids can enjoy and be a helpful tool for artists/designers.

**Alternative projects:**
- [https://kully.github.io/pixel-paint/](https://kully.github.io/pixel-paint/) - fast tools, neat select and copy ability
- [https://makepixelart.com/](https://makepixelart.com/) - has some really cool tools, simple layer setup
- [https://dinopixel.com/](https://dinopixel.com/) - online community, simple animation focus
- [https://www.piskelapp.com/](https://www.piskelapp.com/) - good tool focused around making sprite animations
- [https://www.pixilart.com/draw](https://www.pixilart.com/draw) - if you need a full fledge editor equipped with animation capabilities

*This project was not created to fulfill any sort of course requirement/exercise for a program or institution.*
